    <h1> ADHD Hyperfixation Mode: Activated </h1>

    
 
    <p>
        Here is an attempt of someone with ADHD, me, trying to dump all the information I know about my topic of hyperfixation at the moment.
        I do this often, like spending 8 hours on a Saturday researching about Dissociative Idenity Disorder (DID) after a 30 minute Youtube video at 8AM.
        I don't know anyone with DID, but my curiousity caused me to lose my entire Saturday, and now I know too much. 
        One of my previous hyperfixation was ADHD in Women, and it was due to my own diagnosis late last year. 
        I am still looking for more information and updates as new studies come out, but I am not spending 10 hours a day researching about ADHD anymore. 
        I think there are a lot of information about ADHD in women that are not known, and I get really excited talking about it so here is more information than you will ever need to know about ADHD in women!

     <h2 id="History"> ADHD History </h2>
    <section>
        <article>
            <p> The earliest documented mentioning of ADD/ADHD (Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) was by Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine. 
                In his documentation, there was at least one reference about patients who were experiencing issues with their focus, and reacted quickly to their environment.
                Then in 1798, Sir Alexander Crichton, a Scottish physician, mentioned in his book about "the disease of attention".
                He wrote that people with this condition were mentally restless and had difficulty focusing on a single task.
                Around the same time, John Locke, physician and philosopher, also described a group of students as unable to "keep their mind from straying" </p>
            <p> In the 1800s, medical textbooks during the time described ADHD as "nervous child", "mental instability", "unstable nervous system", "hypermetamorphosis", and "simple hyperexcitability". 
                Years later in 1902, a British pediatrician Sir Geroge Frederic Still noticed a group of children who could not pay attention for a long time.
                According to him, this group of children had a difficult time with self-regulating and could be aggressive, emotional, and defiant despite the lack of intellectual impairments.
                He noted that more boys were affected by this condition, which he called "abnormal defect of moral control". 
                Twenty years after that, doctors looked more into this condition, and they tried to connect postencephalitic behavior disorder (PBD) to the symptoms of what is now known as ADD/ADHD. 
                PBD was caused by a virus that led to brain inflammation. 
                During this time, the effects of benzedrine were being studied by researchers. 
                Benzedrine was the first amphetamine that was developed during that time, and it is a stimulant. 
                A doctor in Rhode Island used it to treat headaches in children, but he noticed there was a change in behavior (school performance and the ability to focus) in these children. 
                With this discorvery, studies began to look for an answer to why a stimulant would make children more calm.
                As a result, benzedrine was used for children with hyperactivity. </p>
            <p> Fast forward a few decades, another stimulant was introduced to the public. 
                This was when methylphenidate (Ritalin) came into the market, but the official name ADD/ADHD was not used yet.
                In 1968, ADD/ADHD was under the name "hyperkinetic reaction of childhood" by the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-II for short.
                The belief at the time was that only children were experiencing this type of restlessness and distractibility, and they believed that it would go away during the time of adolescence.
                With much more understanding about the condition in 1980, DSM-III, named the condition Attention Deficit Disorder, also known as ADD. 
                In 1987, a revised version of DSM-III was published, changing ADD to ADHD. The "H" here stands for hyperactivity, though is not exactly all correct.
                In 1994, DSM-IV was published and it refined the diagnosis, stated that there are three different types of ADHD: inattentive types, hyperactive/impulsive type, and the combined type.
                As of right now, with DSM-5 released in 2013, and the revised version in 2022, the "types" of ADHD are now considered "presentations" as they can change throughout a person's life.
                In our current world of medicine, we have nonstimulants and stimulants for ADHD. </p>

            <p class="meds"> <strong> Non-stimulants ADHD medications include: </strong>
               
                <ul class="list"> 
                    <li> Atomoxetine (Straterra) </li>
                    <li> Guanfacine (Intuniv, Tenex) </li>
                    <li> Clonidine (Kapvay, Catapres) </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="meds"> <strong> Stimulants ADHD medications include: </strong>
                <ul class="list"> 
                    <li> Dextroamphetamine and Amphetamine (Adderall)</li>
                    <li> Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, Quillivant, Daytrana) </li>
                    <li> Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin) </li>
                    <li> Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) </li>
                    <li> Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine, Zenzedi, ProcCentra) </li>
                    <li> Serdexmethylphenidate (Azstarys) </li>
                    <li> Evekeo (Amphetamine sulfate) </li>
                    <li> Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Foquest) </li>
                </ul>

            </p>
            <p> There are currently other newer medications on the market (which means there is a high chance insurance will not cover it, making it too expensive), but these are some of the more popular medications. 
                Till this day, there are still research being conducted to learn more about ADHD as it is more complex than perceived. The cause of ADHD is still unknown, but brain scans have shown that there are differences in 
                how the brain looks between someone with ADHD and someone without ADHD. The differences include neurotransmitters, different sizes in certain areas of the brain, etc.
                Furthermore, an individual is diagnosed with ADHD is four times more likely to have had someone in their family with ADHD as well.
                Therefore, the idea of too much video games or technology causing ADHD is a myth.

    <h2 id="Criteria"> DSM-5 Criteria </h2>

    <h3> What is in the DSM-5 Criteria for soneone to be properly diagnosed for ADHD? </h3>
    <section>
        <article>
            <p> According to the CDC, the individual must meet the following:
            <ul class="list"> 
                <li> Inattention </li>
                <li> Hyperactivity and Impulsivity </li>
                <li> Symptoms must be present before the age of 12 </li>
                <li> Symptoms present in two or more settings (home, school, work, friends, etc.) </li>
                <li> Clear evidence that the symptoms are interfering with daily activities </li>
                <li> Symptoms cannot be explained by another mental disorder. </li>
                <li> An individual must show at least 6 symptoms for children, and 5 for adolescents and older. All symptoms must be present for at least 6 months </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
    
    <img src="brain.webp" alt="diagram of normal versus adhd brain"; style="width:450px; height: 241px; float: right; padding: 10px; margin-left: 50px; margin-top: 50px;">       

    <h3> What is the issue with DSM-5? </h3>
            <p> Looking back at the history of how the criteria was formed, the test was designed for boys, as they are the ones who show symptoms at an earlier age.
                Therefore, it is often get associated as a male didsorder. 
                However, over the past several years, new data has revealed that perhaps the strong bias of the mental disorder might be the reason why women are not often diagnosed with ADHD.
                Women are overlooked when it comes to the diagnosis or they are being treated for co-morbidities of ADHD. Here are some facts:
                <ul class="list">
                    <li> Males are almost three times more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than females. </li>
                    <li> 13% of men will be diagnosed during their lifetime compared to the 4.2% of women. </li>
                    <li> Some studies have estimated that there are 50% to 75% of girls with undiagnosed ADHD. </li>
                    <li> Between 2003 and 2015, the number of prescriptions filled for ADHD for women between the age of 15-44 increased 344 percent.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p> The increase number of women who are diagnosed with ADHD later in life now is the result from the misdiagnosed or undiagnosed mental disorder because they did not fit the DSM-5 criteria.
                While the DSM-5 focuses on a lot of hyperactivity and struggling in school, or failing out of school, women with ADDH often do not experience these. 
                Women with ADHD often exceed academically, and they also display signs and symptoms that are not included in the DSM-5.

        <article> 
            <p> If you look at the CDC website about DSM-5 Criteria for ADHD, there is mentioning of ADHD in adults. 
                However, there is no mentionning of how different the signs and symptoms can be between men and women.
                For women with ADHD, they are often associated with the inattentive type (not all), but they also show different symptoms that what is listed in the criteria.
                Their symptoms are often associated with society's definition as "social" girls:
            <ul class="list">
                <li> Talk a lot. </li>
                <li> Unable to stay still, feel the need to walk around. </li>
                <li> Speak or act in an impulsive manner </li>
                <li> Have no problem making friends, but have difficulty keeping friendships </li>
                <li> Self-harming activities; actities that require extreme or unhealthy self-discipline  </li>
                <li> Have compensation strategies which means working two to three times harder than their peers just to keep up </li>
                <li> Fearful of rejection by others, can remain in unhealthy relationships</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p> 
                While they appear to be "social butterflies" and they are as successful as others, they are struggling mentally by masking.
                Masking refers to an ADHD individual hiding their symptoms and to do whatever it takes to appear "normal". 
                Often, women with ADHD are withdrawn, struggle with perfectionism, depression and anxiety.
                Because they are often overlooked, they are more likely to receive medications treating their co-morbidities such as depression and anxiety rather than ADHD itself. 
                The later the diagnosis, the higher the risk for co-morbidities. When women are struggling to fit in with others, they are more self-aware. 
                They are self-aware that they have to work two to three times harder than others just to recieve the same outcome, but they do not know the reason.
                So, they spiral down in negative thoughts and feel like there is something wrong with them. 
                When there is a repetition of similar experiences throughout their entire lives, they often end up with low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.
                Hormones also play a huge part in women ADHD diagnosis. 
                Studies have shown that the symptoms can get fluctuate based on the level of hormones.
                Therefore, the severity of symptoms can change depending on the normal fluctuation of hormones and puberty as well. 
                This could also lead to a late diagnosis, or an incorrect diagnosis.

            <p> 
                Over the past few years, even more women are diagnosed with ADHD. It is common to hear that becasue of the Tiktok or Instagram reels, everyone thinks they have ADHD and it has become a trend.
                Everyone might have "an ADHD moment", but not everyone is struggling with those symptoms and having "an ADHD moment" everyday of their entire lives.
                Perhaps the huge increase in women being diagnosed is due to the Tiktok and Instagram reels. Women with ADHD often feel like they are isolated and that no one undertands their experiences.
                When one person decides to post videos about ADHD in relation of what it looks like and not from the DSM-5, it encouraged more people to do the same.
                As a result, more undiagnosed women are finding the support to get an official diagnosis themselves. 
                People don't get ADHD from watching too many ADHD videos, those videos just show them that it has always been there.

        <article>
            <p> If you have someone you know with ADHD and you would like to communicate with them effectively, here are some things that can help you understand them better:
            <ul class="list">
                <li> <strong> Hypersensitivy </strong>: ADHD individuals are often extra sensitive to physical or emotional stimuli. Common physical stimuli includes: touch, smell, sound, sight (such as light sensitivity). 
                    Understand that if they step away from a social event, if they get quiet suddenly, it's not because something happened, they are just experiencing hypersensitivity. Stepping away from a social gathering to be somewhere quiet is a way to recollecting themselves.
                    When they are sensitive to light, such as in the grocery stores, it can make them dizzy.
                </li>
                <li> <strong> Financial struggle </strong>: The phrase "out of sight, out of mind" is quite literal for ADHD individuals. So, when they have to throw out food in the fridge becasue they forgot that it's there, or late to pay bills because it's a piece of paper, it all adds up at the end as money wasted.
                    This is known as "ADHD Tax" in the community. 
                </li>
                <li> <strong> Talk Fast </strong>: No matter how hard they try to slow down, they often talk really fast. They either do it impulsively, or they could be very excited, afraid they will forget their train of thought, or they don't really notice that they are doing it. </li>
                <li> <strong> Abnormal eating routine </strong>: Often, when ADHD individuals are hyperfocusing on a task, they forget to eat, drink, and they even forget to use the restroom. It's not that they intentionally do it, they actually forget about even the essentials when they are hyperfocusing. </li>
                <li> <strong> Being messy </strong> : ADHD indivviduals know what they should and need to do, but sometimes, their racing thoughts take over and eventually, it becomes overwhelming to the point of ADHD paralysis.</li>
                
            </ul>

                <li> <strong> Masking </strong>: Hiding ADHD symptoms from others </li>
                <li> <strong> Stimming </strong>: Self-stimulatory behavior; repetition of movement or sounds as a way to self-soothe or engaged; i.e. drawing, staring into space, chewing/biting nails </li>
                <li> <strong> ADHD Paralysis </strong>: Inability to physically move or think effectively due to being overwhelmed by environment, information, or tasks; causes a shut down mentally and is out of their control </li>
                <li> <strong> Rummination </strong>:  Negative thoughts about the past or anxious thoughts aobut the future replaying in infinite loop mentally; aware that it's unhealthy but unable to stop  </li>
                <li> <strong> Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) </strong>: When you experience severe emotions becasue of a failure or feeling rejected </li>
                <li> <strong> Executive Dysfunction </strong>: A symptom that happens with conditions that disrupt the brain's ability to control thoughts, emotions and behavior </li>
                <li> <strong> ADHD Tax </strong>: The money spent wasted on items that have been forgotten about, and the forgotten financial responsibilities. </li>
